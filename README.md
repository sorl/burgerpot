# Burgerpot
Burgerpot is an anagram for bugreport. Burgerpot is a bugreporting system that tries
to enforce clients to submit more information to tickets. I have written this
application to solve my own problems of clients mailing me very bad descriptions
of bugs. We developers need to know how to reproduce a bug in order to solve it.
